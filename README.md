## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_ChrisCebrero](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_ChrisCebrero)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_ChrisCebrero/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Created a cluster monitoring application utilizing Docker, Linux, Bash and PostgreSQL. Developed a startup script that creates a PostgreSQL instance using Docker. Implemented SQL scripts for efficient table management within a Postgres Database which created tables related to hardware specifications and CPU usage. Programmed bash scripts to parse and retrieve essential system information using Regex, and insert them into the corresponding database tables. Manually connected to the PostgreSQL instance to verify information after running scripts. Containerized the application with Docker. Utilized GitHub to host the source code and track any changes. Deployed and automated the process using crontabs, which scheduled bash scripts to run every minute.


## Highlighted Projects
**Web app for Dimensional** [[GitHub](https://github.com/chriscebrero/dimensional-app)]: Engineered API Integrations with RESTful APIs to facilitate data exchange between the frontend and backend. Developed the frontend using React.js and TypeScript. Implemented cross-device styling using Tailwind CSS for a responsive user experience.

**Warbler** [[GitHub](https://github.com/chriscebrero/WarblerApp)]: Developed the frontend using React.js. Utilized Redux for complex state management. Coded backend API endpoints using Node.js to handle server-side logic. Implemented authentication and authorization middleware using JWT tokens. Stored user information within MongoDB.

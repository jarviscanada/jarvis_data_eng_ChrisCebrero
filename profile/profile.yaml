# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I hold a Bachelor's degree in Math and Computer Science and have a diverse professional background, interning at SAP, Beatdapp, and Coursera before joining Binance and Coursera as a full-time employee. In my previous experience, I've worked with mostly TypeScript and React. Previously, I've worked as a Software Engineer at Coursera, where I've executed the implementation of several key features for the Educator Admin Dashboard. While my experience predominantly lies in Front-End development, I'm eager to transition into Data Engineering. The software industry captivates me due to its constant challenges, engaging both my logical and creative faculties. My passion for software is fueled by the satisfaction of problem-solving and the dynamic nature of the field, driving my continuous pursuit of growth and excellence.

    description: "Created a cluster monitoring application utilizing Docker, Linux, Bash and PostgreSQL. Developed a startup script that creates a PostgreSQL instance using Docker. Implemented SQL scripts for efficient table management within a Postgres database which created tables related to hardware specifications and CPU usage. Programmed bash scripts to parse and retrieve essential system information using Regex, and insert them into the corresponding database tables. Manually connected to the PostgreSQL instance to verify information after running scripts. Containerized the application with Docker. Utilized GitHub to host the source code and track any changes. Deployed and automated the process using crontabs, which scheduled bash scripts to run every minute."
